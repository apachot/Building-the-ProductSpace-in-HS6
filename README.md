# ProductSpace_HS6

We propose a HS6 version of the famous Product Space developed by Harvard. If you want to know more about the Product Space, and the work on Economic Complexity, I invite you to visit https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu.

The version that can be found online is limited to product classes on 4 digits (about 1600 classes). Here we propose an enriched version with more than 5000 classes.

You can retrieve directly in the /output folder the proximity data between classes and the json network associated to the Product Space represented in 2D.

The project is still under development, all data are not yet available.
